# GNOME
Code of the EACL 2023 Paper: [Fine-Tuning Deteriorates General Textual Out-of-Distribution Detection by Distorting Task-Agnostic Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12715)

For the complete code, we refer readers to another repo created by us: [Code for OOD Detection Research in NLP](https://github.com/lancopku/Avg-Avg). It contains the algorithm GNOME introduced in the paper and a wide array of baselines.
